#Introduction

Hello and welcome to my malware repository :)!

before we start i just want to say when using this please make sure you are using them on a virtual machine not on your host and on the vm you are not signed in to anything important e.g: banking as that data may be STOLEN :(

Most of people say: "Malware isn't a toy to play with!", however, I don't hold such an opinion. Malware is fun, if you know how to play with it! ðŸ˜‰ In my opinion, people who think opposite are gloomy and tedious or just afraid of it. neatheless DO NOT use this malware for personal benifit 

As i test malware on my youtube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvdN50Ep5FyWf2cpA19a9Eg) it will appear here shourtly after the premiere :)
